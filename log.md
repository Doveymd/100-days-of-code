### Day13:Jan 18 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Built a small mad lib with jave. 

**Thoughts** I was scared when I start the mad libs project. It was like I had no where to begin. But as I read over my notes, I became comfortable and just started programming. And believe or not.. it flowed. Yeah, should never had left the programming field.
